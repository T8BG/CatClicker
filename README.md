The objective of this project is to create a clicker-type game using the tools and features we have learned in the class, and using the tools that are present in the Android development ecosystem. This app will be used purely for entertainment with features similar to the game, “Cookie Clicker”, along with featuring pet simulator mechanics that the user will have to take care of, during the course of the game.
